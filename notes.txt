Von Nuemann architecture divides the computer up into two main parts - CPU (Central Processing Unit) and the Memory.

The computer's memory is used for a number of different things. All of the results
of any calculations are stored in memory. In fact, everything that is "stored" is
stored in memory. In addition to all of this, the Von Neumann architecture specifies
that not only computer data should live in memory, but the programs that control the computer’s
operation should live there, too. In fact, in a computer, there is no difference
between a program and a program’s data except how it is used by the computer.
They are both stored and accessed the same way.

The CPU reads in instructions from memory one at a time and executes them. This
is known as the fetch-execute cycle. The CPU contains the following elements to
accomplish this: Program Counter, Instruction Decoder, Data bus, General-purpose registers,
Arithmetic and logic unit.
